What is SmallWM?
================
SmallWM is an extended version of TinyWM, made for actual desktop use.

Improvements over TinyWM
========================
o Window Iconification - Windows can be hidden with Alt+h, when they are hidden and placed
in little rectangles at the top of the screen.

o Window ``Layering`` - Windows can be layered, but little policy is actually enforced. 
Works at a basic level. Raise with Alt+PgUp, lower with Alt+PgDn.

o Focus-Follows-Pointer - The focus follows the pointer, which prevents focus stealing by
applications.

o Window Placeholders - SmallWM does not do window resizing and moving directly, because
that is a graphically intensive operation. It instead uses placeholder windows that it 
deletes after moving.

o Window Borders - Just a simple border to see the extent of a window.

o Startup File - The startup file is named by user "$USER.sh" in /etc/user.d

Install
=======
Run `install.sh` as root. This will put all the files in /usr/local and an xsession file
in the /usr/share/xsessions directory.

Todo
====
o Trying to implement a "Focus-Upon-Click" policy - hasn't worked out well so far
