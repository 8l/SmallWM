This is smallwm, which is my personal, refactored version of tinywm that I've hacked a little bit to add some basic features.

Improvements over TinyWM
========================

o Ability to move windows up or down (via Alt+PgUp/Alt+PgDn)
o Run xterm by Alt+Button1 on the root window
o Window borders
o Pointer-follows-Focus (active, as opposed TinyWM passive)

o Better hackabiltiy - SmallWM is refactored, so it's easier to add
stuff to it than it would be to TinyWM

Install
======================
Run `install.sh`

Credits

License
======================
In the spirit of the original TinyWM, SmallWM is public domain
as well. Simply keep this README file (or credit me and the original author) with any distribution you make.

Contrary to popular belief, I DO know where you live. And I've got
a couple knives to sharpen on the way, if need be ;)
