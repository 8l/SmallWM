This is smallwm, which is my personal, refactored version of tinywm that I've hacked a little bit to add some basic features.

Improvements over TinyWM
========================

o Maxmizing function - Alt+m
o Window Lowering function - Alt+Page_Down
o Closing Function? - Alt+c
o WM Quit Function? - Alt+Escape
o Creating of window borders

o Better hackabiltiy - SmallWM is refactored, so it's easier to add
stuff to it than it would be to TinyWM

Install
======================
Run `install.sh`

Contrary to popular belief, I DO know where you live. And I've got
a couple knives to sharpen on the way, if need be ;)
